  Release
---------------------------------------------------------------

We proudly present Pligg 1.0.0 RC1.
Released January 30, 2009 1:45PM EST

This release candidate (RC) version of Pligg is designed as a
test version of Pligg. We require users to help us find any
final bugs that we may have missed, whether caused by
unexpected server settings or us just not checking things
carefully enough.

There have been hundreds of changes since our previous release
and anyone who has previously used Pligg will see why. The 
latest version offers a much more solid product with a 
fantastic new admin panel that will help you better manage 
your Pligg website.

We recommend that you do not use this version in a production
environment unless you are willing to experience the occasional
bug and want to manually update your site until we release a
final version of 1.0.
